- don't expect much to come out of here. just a place to host dots and my blog really. 

- i sometimes contribute to open source but that's normally through feedback on discord rather than programming.

- if you went searching my username and found this, welcome ig xd

## how i made my blog

i use a framework called hugo, which is really fast and easy to pick up. i write everything in markdown and export it into the website repo which is the html and css you guys see.
